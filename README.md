What is the Lambda Annotations Framework?

The Lambda Annotations Framework provides a natural programming model for .NET developers to create AWS Lambda functions. The new framework uses C# custom attributes and Source Generators to translate annotated Lambda functions to the regular Lambda programming model. Source Generators create new C# source code and incorporate that code during compilation. The Lambda Annotations Framework does not impact Lambda startup times because it translates your code at compile time.
